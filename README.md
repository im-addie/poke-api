### 💻 Code Stack
JavaScript, React, and Material UI

### 📋 Overview
The Pokédex is a project that combines my passion for video games with my journey in learning the React framework. The Pokédex utilizes the [Poke API](https://pokeapi.co/) to fetch data for the original 151 Pokémon. As a first-time React user, this repository serves as a hands-on learning experience for me, allowing me to apply React concepts while creating an interactive and user-friendly Pokédex application.

### ✨ Features
- Landing page
  - Showcases a list of cards showing the original 151 Pokémon with their image, name and type.
- Details page
  - Goes into detail of each Pokémon such as their type, weight (in kgs), height, abilities, and their base stats.

### 🛠️ Installation
- Open an integrated terminal for the "poke-api" folder and run `npm install` to install dependencies.

### 🚀 Starting the app
- Using the intergrated terminal, run `npm start` to start the app! 
  - This should automatically open your browser with the link http://localhost:3000 to access the app.
